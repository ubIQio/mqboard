Blinky Demo for MQBoard
=======================

The blinky demo app blinks an LED at a rate controlled via MQTT. Its purpose is to explore running
in normal mode vs. in safe-mode and seeing the various logging options as well as file
synchronization. The code also has simple examples for subscribing to messages, receiving messages,
and sending messages.

### Try it out

This section assumes you completed the "first steps" in `../README.md`, i.e. you have the board
up and running in safe-mode.

1. The first step is to prepare a `board_config.py` (again). The difference between this board config
   and the one in the board directory is that the mqtt prefix is now `esp32/blinky` (you can change
   that of course) and it includes SNTP to sync time, a sysinfo background task, and the blinky app:
```
    cp board_config_tmpl.py board_config.py
    vim board_config.py # edit clearly marked lines
```

2. Update the safe mode files on the board over MQTT. Note that the command below assumes your
   board is configured according to the "first steps" and thus the repl is subscribed
   to `esp32/test/mqb`. After the update and a reset it will instead subscribe to
   `esp32/blinky/mqb` (you still have the window/pane/tab running showing the board's terminal
   output, right?).
```
    $ ./sync-safemode -s 10.0.0.203 --prefix esp32/mqtest
    Target directory /safemode
      put  missing ./mpy-lib/sntp.py -> /safemode/sntp.py
      ok   main.py
      ok   logging.py
      ok   board.py
      ok   mqtt.py
      ok   mqrepl.py
      ok   watchdog.py
      ok   mqtt_async.py
      put  shadiff ./board_config.py -> /safemode/board_config.py
    Target directory /
      ok   boot.py
```
   The output shows that one file was missing (`sntp.py`) and one file changed (`board_config.py`).
   (If your shell doesn't like the `#!` at the top of `sync-safemode` you can also use
   `../mqboard/mqboard --prefix esp32/test sync sync-safemode`.)

   In the terminal window you should have seen log lines that indicate repl activity:
```
    I 111425   mqrepl: Dispatch eval, msglen=530 seq=0 last=True id=DffT_1E2 dup=0
```
   as well as text output by those commands as part of an `exec()`:
```
    'mqrepl.py':'de77a2b153c806b0dd59f1fb1ac4f7ccf56fe291'
```
   Those lines are captured by the repl and sent back over MQTT where the `mqboard sync` tool
   uses them (the line above is the SHA1 of the `mqrepl.py` file used to determine whether the
   file is up-to-date).

3. Optionally open another terminal window/pane/tab and run `../mqboard/mqboard --prefix
   esp32/blinky view`. This will show the lines sent by the logger over MQTT as the board
   boots in the next step.

4. Now reset the board and watch the USB log show about the same as previously.
   Once the board connects to MQTT you should see the other terminal window running
   `mqboard view` replay most of the log. Except for the ESP-IDF lines that are missing,
   it should be identical. These log lines were buffered in memory until the conenction
   was established and the board config controls the max amount of buffering.

   Something else you should notice is that the timestamps on the log lines switch from
   milliseconds-since-boot to hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds.
   (The hour may not be correct due to some caching in the logger that causes the time zone not to
   be applied until the top of the next hour: that's an open issue.)

5. Note that there is a time-out on safe mode (set to 3 minutes in the board config) after which
   it attempts to switch back to normal mode if the watchdog is ticking along fine.
   If that happens you will see a magenta message
   `C 00:58:54.405 watchdog: Switching to NORMAL MODE via reset`.
   Just wait until it's connected again...

6. Finally it's time to load the blinky app:
```
    $ ./sync -s 10.0.0.203 --prefix iDAQ/virac
    Target directory /lib
      mkdir /lib
      put  missing ./mpy-lib/sntp.py -> /lib/sntp.py
      put  missing ./mpy-lib/sysinfo.py -> /lib/sysinfo.py
      put  missing ../board/logging.py -> /lib/logging.py
      put  missing ../board/board.py -> /lib/board.py
      put  missing ../board/mqtt.py -> /lib/mqtt.py
      put  missing ../mqrepl/mqrepl.py -> /lib/mqrepl.py
      put  missing ../mqrepl/watchdog.py -> /lib/watchdog.py
      put  missing ./../mqtt_async/mqtt_async.py -> /lib/mqtt_async.py
    Target directory /src
      mkdir /src
      put  missing ./blinky.py -> /src/blinky.py
    Target directory /
      put  missing ../board/main.py -> /main.py
      ok   board_config.py
      put  missing ../board/boot.py -> /boot.py
```

7. Reset the board via MQTT:
```
    $ ../mqboard/mqboard --prefix esp32/blinky reset
    C 01:06:11.400     main: Resetting via mqboard safemode=False
```
   The LED on your board should now be blinking a little faster than 1Hz. let's slow it down.
   You will need to dig up your favorite tool for sending an MQTT message to your broker
   to the topic `esp32/blinky/period` with a message contents of the period in milliseconds as
   ascii string. Here's how this looks for me:
```
    $ mosquitto_pub -h 192.168.0.14 -u core -t esp32/blinky/period -m "2000"
```
   And the LED should now blink at 0.5Hz.

8. With a little patience you can see one of the sysinfo messages, which is
   sent once every 20 seconds, so you may have to way for a bit. Note that `--topic`
   is used instead of `--prefix` to provide the exact topic:
```
    $ ../mpy-mqtt/mqboard/mqboard --topic esp32/blinky/sysinfo view
    {"up":13,"free":65632,"cont_free":43488,"mqtt_conn":1}
```
   The message shows an uptime of 13 seconds, 64KB of free memory, a largest free block of 43KB,
   and one MQTT connection (this is a reconnection counter, not a count of concurrent connections as
   there is always at most one).

- to learn more about how the board boots and starts the app, as well as safe mode see
  the README in the board directory
- to learn more about the MQTT Repl, see the README in the mqrepl directory
- to learn more about the mqboard command line too, see the README in the mqboard directory
